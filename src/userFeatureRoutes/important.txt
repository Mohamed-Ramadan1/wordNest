note related to the routes 

while tray convert the application to support the DI(dependency injection) a wired problem start to appear only at the users feature 
the container that coming from config directory is start to be undefined in only the users feature its work normally in the other features
and the entire application i did a many changes across the application to tray to solve the problem but i didn't find any solution
i tray to change the way of the import the container in the users feature but the problem still exist. i convert import to dynamic imports also the problem still exist
so i decide after spending around 6 days in this problem and after tray every possible solution to move the route files out of the feature to complete DI Integration where the feature is a 
very important feature in the application  and later if found solution for this problem then i will refactor the application to working with this problem.

now after moving the routes files out of the feature the application is working normally and the problem is solved.
